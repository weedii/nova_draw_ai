Step 1: Draw a round shape for the body of the apple in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add a small curved line at the top of the apple to indicate the stem, keeping the rounded body exactly as it is.
Step 3: Draw a leaf shape to the left of the stem, slightly overlapping it, while maintaining the rounded body and stem.
Step 4: Add a gentle curve near the bottom of the apple to suggest a small dimple, ensuring the rounded body, stem, and leaf remain unchanged.
Step 5: Draw a tiny highlight circle near the upper left side of the apple's body to give it some personality, keeping all previous elements intact.
