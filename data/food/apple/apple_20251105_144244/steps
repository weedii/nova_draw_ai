Step 1: Draw a round, plump shape for the body of the apple in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add a small, curved indentation at the top of the apple's body to represent where the stem will go.
Step 3: Draw a short, thick stem emerging from the indentation at the top of the apple (the body shape remains unchanged).
Step 4: Add a single, broad leaf coming from the stem, positioned slightly to the side, while keeping the body and stem exactly as they are.
Step 5: Include a subtle rounded highlight on the upper left side of the apple's body to suggest shine (the body, stem, and leaf stay unchanged).
Step 6: Draw a tiny, downward curve at the bottom of the apple’s body to give it a more natural shape (the body, stem, leaf, and highlight remain exactly the same).
