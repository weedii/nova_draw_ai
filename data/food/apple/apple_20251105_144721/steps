Step 1: Draw a round, slightly elongated shape for the body of the apple in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add a small, curved dip at the top of the apple shape to represent the stem area (the apple shape stays the same).
Step 3: Draw a short, thick curved line rising from the dip at the top to create the apple's stem (the body of the apple and dip stay exactly the same).
Step 4: Add a small oval leaf attached to the stem on one side, angled slightly upward (the apple body, dip, and stem stay exactly the same).
Step 5: Draw a subtle line or two near the bottom of the apple to suggest its natural contour and give it a plump look (the body, dip, stem, and leaf stay exactly the same).
