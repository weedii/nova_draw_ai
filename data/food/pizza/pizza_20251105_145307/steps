Step 1: Draw a large circle in the center of your paper to represent the pizza's crust.
Step 2: Add a smaller circle inside the larger circle, leaving a space around the edge for the crust.
Step 3: Draw several wavy lines inside the smaller circle to create the texture of melted cheese.
Step 4: Place random small circles all over the cheese area to represent toppings like pepperoni.
