Step 1: Draw a large, round crust that forms a perfect circle in the center of your paper.
Step 2: Add a slightly smaller circle inside the crust to represent the pizza base, leaving the crust intact.
Step 3: Draw various irregular shapes within the base to create patches for toppings like pepperoni and vegetables, ensuring they are scattered around but still leave plenty of visible base.
Step 4: Add several small oval shapes at random locations on top of the pizza base to represent pepperoni slices (the crust and base stay unchanged).
