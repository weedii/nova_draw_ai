Step 1: Draw a large round shape in the center of your paper to create the pizza crust.
Step 2: Add a slightly smaller round shape inside the first one to represent the pizza base, leaving a border of the crust around it.
Step 3: Draw several wavy lines inside the pizza base, following the circular shape, to depict the melted cheese stretching across the surface.
Step 4: Place various small circular shapes scattered across the pizza base to represent toppings like pepperoni, mushrooms, and bell peppers.
