Step 1: Draw a rectangular body shape with slightly rounded corners to represent the main frame of the car.
Step 2: Add two large circles at the bottom, equally spaced from each end of the rectangle, to serve as the car wheels.
Step 3: Draw a smaller rectangle on the top of the main body, slightly offset towards the back, to create the car's cabin.
Step 4: Add a curved line on top of the cabin rectangle to form the car's roof, connecting the edges smoothly to the main body rectangle.
Step 5: Draw two rounded headlights on the front side of the main body, positioned at the upper corners, to give the car a friendly face.
Step 6: Add a vertical line towards the back of the cabin to represent the rear window, making sure it’s centered and proportional.
Step 7: Draw small rectangles on the side of the body just behind the front wheels, depicting the door handles, to complete the car's basic features.
