Step 1: Draw a wide, horizontal rectangle for the main body of the car in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add two slightly rounded rectangles on top of the body for the windshield and roof, positioned towards the left side of the main body.
Step 3: Draw two large circles, one on each side of the car's body, to create the wheels, making sure they are positioned towards the bottom corners of the rectangle.
Step 4: Add a smaller rectangle at the front of the car body for the hood, creating a slight overhang, and make it a little narrower than the main body rectangle.
Step 5: Draw a small rectangular shape at the back of the car for the trunk, ensuring it aligns well with the back end of the main body.
Step 6: Add two horizontal oval shapes on the front and back of the car for the headlights and taillights, placing them just outside the edges of the body rectangle.
Step 7: Draw a smooth curved line connecting the top of the windshield to the back of the car, creating a roofline that slightly slopes downwards towards the rear.
