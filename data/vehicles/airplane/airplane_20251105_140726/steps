Step 1: Draw a wide, elongated oval shape horizontally for the airplane's body in the center of your paper.
Step 2: Add a small pointed triangle at the front end of the oval for the nose, ensuring it is centered and slightly extends beyond the body.
Step 3: Draw two large, straight wings extending out from both sides of the airplane's body, placing them about one-third back from the front tip of the oval.
Step 4: Add a vertical stabilizer at the rear end of the oval by drawing a small rectangle extending upwards from the top of the body, centered at the back.
Step 5: Draw two rounded engines hanging beneath the wings, placing one on each side, slightly closer to the body than to the wing tips.
Step 6: Add a row of small round windows along the length of the airplane's body, making sure they are evenly spaced and centered relative to the body.
Step 7: Draw a small tail wing extending horizontally from either side of the vertical stabilizer to complete the airplane's shape, ensuring its placement is level with the top of the stabilizer.
