Step 1: Draw a streamlined airplane body shape that tapers slightly at both ends, positioned horizontally in the center of your paper.
Step 2: Add a rounded nose at the front of the airplane body, keeping the body shape exactly as it is.
Step 3: Draw two wings extending outward from the middle of the airplane body, making them slightly angled upward, while ensuring the body and nose remain unchanged.
Step 4: Add a vertical tail fin at the back of the airplane body, which stands straight up and maintains the same width as the body.
Step 5: Position two small curved engines under each wing, ensuring they are evenly spaced and do not alter the previously drawn wings and body.
Step 6: Draw two round windows on the upper side of the airplane body, positioned just behind the nose, without changing any other existing elements.
