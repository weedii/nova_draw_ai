Step 1: Draw a rounded rectangular body of the airplane in the center of your paper.
Step 2: Add a slightly pointed nose shape at the front of the body that extends out and keeps the rectangle shape intact.
Step 3: Draw two small rounded wings on either side of the body, positioned a little farther back from the nose, ensuring they are symmetrical.
Step 4: Add a vertical stabilizer fin at the back top of the body, rising slightly above the back end of the rectangle.
Step 5: Draw two smaller horizontal stabilizing wings on either side of the vertical fin, making sure they extend parallel to the main wings.
Step 6: Add two round windows in the upper part of the body, just behind the nose, placed side by side.
Step 7: Draw four small circular wheels at the bottom of the body, two positioned near the front and two near the back, ensuring they are evenly spaced from the body.
