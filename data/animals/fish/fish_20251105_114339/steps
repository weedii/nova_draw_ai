Step 1: Draw an oval shape for the fish's body, slightly pointed at one end to represent the head.
Step 2: Add a small triangular fin on the top of the body, positioned closer to the head, with the tip facing upwards.
Step 3: Draw a round eye near the pointed end of the body, with a tiny dot inside for the pupil.
Step 4: Add a small curved mouth just below the eye, giving the fish a friendly expression.
Step 5: Attach a large triangular tail fin at the wider end of the body, with the point facing outward and slightly curved for movement.
Step 6: Draw two small curved fins on the sides of the body, placing one nearly at the front and the other towards the back, ensuring they are symmetric.
