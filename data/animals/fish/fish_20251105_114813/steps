Step 1: Draw an oval shape for the fish's body, slightly pointed at one end to form the head.
Step 2: Add a small triangular fin on the top of the body, positioned about a third of the way back from the head.
Step 3: Draw a round eye near the front of the head, and place a tiny dot inside for the pupil.
Step 4: Add a small curved mouth right below the eye to give the fish a friendly expression.
Step 5: Draw a large, flowing tail fin at the back of the body, making it wide and wavy to add movement.
Step 6: Create two smaller, rounded side fins, one on each side of the body, positioned near the middle.
