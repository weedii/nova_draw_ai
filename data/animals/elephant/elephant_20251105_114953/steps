Step 1: Draw a large rounded head in the center with a gentle curve at the top.
Step 2: Add two large floppy ears on either side of the head, positioned slightly below the top curve of the head.
Step 3: Draw a long, curved trunk extending downward from the center of the head, tapering off slightly at the end.
Step 4: Add two big friendly eyes with small dots inside, positioned above the trunk and slightly to the sides of the head.
Step 5: Draw a rounded body shape connected below the head, with a slight bulge at the center to emphasize the elephant's size.
Step 6: Add four sturdy legs extending down from the body, with the front legs positioned slightly closer to the head than the back legs.
Step 7: Draw a short, curved tail coming from the back of the body, with a tuft at the end to give it more character.
