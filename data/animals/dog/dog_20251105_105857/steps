Step 1: Draw a round fluffy head in the center.
Step 2: Add two floppy ears on either side of the head that have soft curves, with the top slightly drooping down.
Step 3: Draw two big friendly eyes with tiny dots inside, positioned in the upper part of the head, ensuring they are spaced apart evenly.
Step 4: Add a small button nose centered below and between the eyes, shaping it like an oval that slightly points downward.
Step 5: Draw a rounded body shape connected below the head, making sure it has a bit of width to give it a fluffy appearance.
Step 6: Add four short legs extending down from the body, keeping them slightly bent to suggest a playful stance.
Step 7: Draw a wagging tail rising from the back of the body, curving upwards to show that the dog is happy.
