Step 1: Draw a rounded fluffy head in the center.
Step 2: Add two floppy ears on each side of the head, gently curved downwards (the head stays exactly the same).
Step 3: Draw two big friendly eyes with small dots inside, positioned above the nose and spaced evenly on the head (head and ears stay exactly the same).
Step 4: Add a tiny button nose in the middle, just below the eyes (head, ears, and eyes stay exactly the same).
Step 5: Draw a rounded body shape connected below the head, making sure it has a slight curve to suggest a fluffy belly (all previous elements stay exactly the same).
Step 6: Add four short legs extending down from the body, ensuring they are positioned evenly and curving slightly outward (head, ears, eyes, nose, and body stay exactly the same).
Step 7: Draw a wagging tail on the back right side of the body, curving upwards to show excitement (all previous elements stay exactly the same).
