Step 1: Draw a rounded head in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add two floppy ears on either side of the head, slightly curved downwards (the head stays exactly the same).
Step 3: Draw two big friendly eyes with small dots inside, positioned in the upper part of the head (head and ears stay exactly the same).
Step 4: Add a small rounded nose below and between the eyes, with a gentle smile curving down from it (head, ears, and eyes stay exactly the same).
Step 5: Draw a fluffy body shape connected below the head, slightly wider than the head (all previous elements stay exactly the same).
Step 6: Add four short legs extending down from the body, with small rounded paws at the ends (head, ears, eyes, nose, and body stay exactly the same).
Step 7: Draw a wagging, curved tail coming from the back right side of the body (all previous elements stay exactly the same).
