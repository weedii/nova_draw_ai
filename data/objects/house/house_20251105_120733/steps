Step 1: Draw a large rectangle for the main structure of the house in the center of your paper.
Step 2: Add a triangle on top of the rectangle to create the roof, ensuring the triangle's base aligns perfectly with the top edges of the rectangle.
Step 3: Draw a small rectangular door in the center of the house, positioned below the roof and centered within the rectangle.
Step 4: Add two square windows on either side of the door, ensuring they are the same size and positioned evenly within the house's walls.
Step 5: Draw a small rectangular chimney on the roof, placed slightly off to one side near the peak of the triangle.
Step 6: Add a small curved path leading from the door down to the bottom of the paper, starting wide at the door and tapering as it extends away.
