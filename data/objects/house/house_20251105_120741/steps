Step 1: Draw a large rectangular shape for the main part of the house in the center of your paper.
Step 2: Add a triangle on top of the rectangular shape for the roof, making sure the base of the triangle aligns with the top of the rectangle.
Step 3: Draw a rectangular door in the center of the house, placing it slightly above the bottom of the rectangle and ensuring it's narrower than the house itself.
Step 4: Add two square windows on either side of the door, positioned halfway up the rectangle and equally spaced apart from the door.
Step 5: Draw a small chimney extending from the peak of the triangle roof, positioned towards the left side of the roof.
Step 6: Add a pathway leading up to the door, starting from the bottom of the rectangle and widening as it approaches the door.
