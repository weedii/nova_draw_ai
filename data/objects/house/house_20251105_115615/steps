Step 1: Draw a large square base in the center of the page to form the main structure of the house.
Step 2: Add a tall triangle shape on top of the square to create the roof, ensuring the base of the triangle aligns perfectly with the top edges of the square.
Step 3: Draw a centered rectangular door on the front side of the square, making sure it is positioned in the lower half, with the top of the door just below the roof line.
Step 4: Add two square windows, equally spaced on either side of the door, ensuring they are positioned near the upper half of the square and aligned with the roof.
Step 5: Create a small chimney on the top right side of the roof by drawing a smaller rectangle extending upward.
Step 6: Add a simple pathway leading from the bottom of the door down toward the bottom of the page, starting slightly wider at the door and narrowing as it extends outward.
