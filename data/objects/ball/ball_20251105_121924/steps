Step 1: Draw a perfect circle in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add a small oval shape near the top right of the circle to represent a highlight on the ball.
Step 3: Draw a curved line across the middle of the circle, creating two sections, like a seam.
Step 4: Add another curved line that arcs from the left side to the right, intersecting the first line, to form a cross pattern on the ball.
Step 5: Draw a slightly curved shadow line along the bottom of the circle to give the ball a sense of roundness.
Step 6: Add a tiny dot in the center of the highlight oval to represent light reflection, keeping all previous elements the same.
