Step 1: Draw a perfect circle in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add a slightly curved horizontal line across the top half of the circle to represent the seam of the ball (the circle stays exactly the same).
Step 3: Draw another slightly curved horizontal line parallel to the first one, but closer to the bottom of the circle to create the illusion of depth (the circle and the first seam stay exactly the same).
Step 4: Add a small oval shape on the top side of the ball, slightly off-center, to represent a highlight reflecting light (the circle and the seams stay exactly the same).
Step 5: Draw a second smaller oval shape on the bottom side of the ball, also slightly off-center, to enhance the 3D effect (the circle, seams, and highlight stay exactly the same).
Step 6: Add a thin vertical line running down the middle of the ball from the top seam to the bottom seam to indicate the division of its panels (the circle, seams, and highlights stay exactly the same).
