Step 1: Draw a large perfect circle in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add another smaller circle near the top left side of the large circle to represent a highlight.
Step 3: Sketch a curved line across the middle of the large circle to form a seam, running from one side to the other.
Step 4: Draw an additional curved line above the seam that follows the shape of the large circle, creating the top half and bottom half separated by the seam.
Step 5: Add a small oval shape at the bottom of the large circle to represent a shadow or reflection.
Step 6: Draw a few short lines radiating from the curved seam to suggest texture on the ball's surface, maintaining the round shape.
