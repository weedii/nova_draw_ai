Step 1: Draw a large five-pointed star shape in the center of your paper, with each point being long and sharp.
Step 2: Add a smaller five-pointed star inside the first star, ensuring it is perfectly centered and retains the same sharp points.
Step 3: Draw a circle in the center of the smaller star, making it a bit larger than the intersection point of the inner star's arms but still contained within the small star.
Step 4: Add a small curved smile just below the center circle to give the star a happy expression, making sure it is centered relative to the circle.
Step 5: Draw two big friendly eyes on either side of the center circle, ensuring they are round and slightly spaced apart, giving the star an expressive look.
