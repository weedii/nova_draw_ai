Step 1: Draw a simple five-pointed star shape in the center of your paper with equal lengths for each arm.
Step 2: Add a small circle in the middle of the star, ensuring it is perfectly centered without changing the star shape.
Step 3: Draw a tiny curved line at the end of each point of the star to create a playful bounce effect, while keeping the star and circle unchanged.
Step 4: Add a series of small, evenly spaced dots around the star to represent twinkling stars in the night sky, making sure they do not touch the star or the circle.
