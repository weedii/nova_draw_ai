Step 1: Draw a simple five-point star shape in the center of your page, ensuring each point is sharp and pointed, with the star standing upright.
Step 2: Add a smaller star inside the first star, aligning it perfectly so that the points of the inner star tuck into the spaces between the points of the outer star.
Step 3: Draw a happy face on the outer star by adding two big friendly eyes above the center and a wide smiling mouth just below them, positioned centrally between the eyes.
