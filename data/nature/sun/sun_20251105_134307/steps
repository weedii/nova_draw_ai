Step 1: Draw a large circle in the center of your paper to form the main body of the sun.
Step 2: Add eight evenly spaced, straight rays extending outward from the circle, making them long and slightly pointed at the ends.
Step 3: Draw a friendly face inside the circle by adding two big round eyes with small dots inside, and a wide, cheerful smile just below the eyes.
Step 4: Place a small curved nose right between the eyes, sitting above the smile (the circle, rays, and facial features all stay exactly the same).
Step 5: Add small, curved lines above the eyes for eyebrows, giving your sun a joyful expression (the circle, rays, and facial features all remain unchanged).
Step 6: Draw some tiny, wavy lines between the rays to create a sense of warmth and energy emanating from the sun (the circle, rays, and face are still intact).
