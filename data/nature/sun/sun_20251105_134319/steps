🔹Step 1: Draw a large circle in the center of your paper to represent the sun's core.
🔹Step 2: Add eight elongated triangles evenly spaced around the circle to create sun rays, extending outwards from the core.
🔹Step 3: Draw a small smiling mouth near the bottom of the circle to give the sun a friendly expression, while keeping the core and rays unchanged.
🔹Step 4: Add two big friendly eyes above the mouth, with tiny dots inside for pupils, ensuring they are positioned symmetrically and maintain the existing elements.
🔹Step 5: Draw small curved eyebrows above the eyes to enhance the cheerful expression, making sure the core, rays, mouth, and eyes stay exactly as they are.
🔹Step 6: Include a few small, wavy lines around the sun rays to suggest warmth and energy radiating from the sun, preserving all previous features without alteration.
