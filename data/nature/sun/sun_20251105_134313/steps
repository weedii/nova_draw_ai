Step 1: Draw a large circle in the center of your page to form the sun's round face.
Step 2: Add two small, friendly eyes near the top of the circle, each with a tiny dot inside for sparkle.
Step 3: Draw a small, curved smile slightly below the eyes to give the sun a cheerful expression.
Step 4: Add rays around the circle by drawing eight long, straight lines extending outward from the edge of the circle, spaced evenly apart.
Step 5: At the end of each ray, draw a short, triangular shape pointing outward to give the rays a spiky look.
