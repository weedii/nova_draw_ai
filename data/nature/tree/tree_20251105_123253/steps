Step 1: Draw a tall, vertical trunk shape that is wider at the bottom than at the top, with some gentle curves to create a natural look.
Step 2: Add two thick, horizontal branches extending from the upper part of the trunk, curving slightly upwards and positioned on either side.
Step 3: Draw an uneven, fluffy crown of leaves at the top of the trunk and branches, making it wider at the bottom and tapering toward the top to create a vibrant tree shape.
Step 4: Add small clusters of leaves within the crown that look like little oval shapes, scattered throughout and overlapping slightly to give the tree fullness.
