Step 1: Draw a tall, narrow trunk in the center, with a slight curve to give it a natural look.
Step 2: Add a broad, rounded canopy on top of the trunk, making sure it slightly extends wider than the trunk on all sides.
Step 3: Draw several large, fluffy cloud-like shapes within the canopy, spaced out to create a textured appearance for the leaves.
Step 4: Add a few smaller rounded shapes peeking out between the larger ones in the canopy, to create depth and fullness.
Step 5: Draw two or three short, curved roots extending from the bottom of the trunk, connecting it firmly to the ground.
Step 6: Add a few simple oval shapes at the base of the trunk to represent grass, scattered around the roots.
