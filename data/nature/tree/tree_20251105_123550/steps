Step 1: Draw a tall, vertical trunk in the center, with a slight curve for a natural appearance.
Step 2: Add two thick, rounded branches extending from the upper part of the trunk, one to the left and one to the right.
Step 3: Draw a large, fluffy canopy of leaves on top, starting just above the branches and filling out in a rounded shape that extends slightly past the branches.
Step 4: Add smaller clusters of leaves at the ends of each branch, maintaining the fluffy appearance of the canopy.
Step 5: Draw a few textured lines on the trunk to represent the bark, making sure they follow the curve of the trunk and branches.
