Step 1: Draw a round center for the flower in the middle of your paper.
Step 2: Add five petal shapes around the flower's center, each petal being a rounded teardrop shape that points outward.
Step 3: Draw a sturdy stem extending downward from the center of the flower, slightly curved to one side for a more natural look.
Step 4: Add two large, oval leaves on either side of the stem, positioned about halfway down the stem, with the tips pointing outwards.
Step 5: Draw a few small lines inside each petal to represent the veins, starting from the base and radiating outwards toward the tips of the petals.
Step 6: Add a couple of tiny circles around the flower's center to depict pollen for added detail.
