Step 1: Draw a small circular center for the flower in the middle of your page.
Step 2: Add five rounded petal shapes extending outward from the circular center, evenly spaced around it.
Step 3: Draw a tall, narrow stem extending downward from the center of the flower, directly beneath it.
Step 4: Add two large, leaf shapes on either side of the stem, with the pointed ends pointing outward, just below the flower.
Step 5: Include small veins in each leaf by drawing a few simple lines starting from the stem and branching out toward the edges of the leaves.
Step 6: Draw a few small circles or dots around the flower to represent a garden environment, positioned randomly for a whimsical touch.
