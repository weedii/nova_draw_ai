Step 1: Draw a small circular center for the flower in the middle of your page.
Step 2: Add five rounded petal shapes evenly spaced around the center, extending outward.
Step 3: Draw a curved stem extending straight down from the bottom of the flower’s center.
Step 4: Add two large leaf shapes on either side of the stem, slightly angled outward.
Step 5: Include a few small curved lines in each petal to suggest texture, keeping the petals as they are.
Step 6: Draw tiny lines radiating from the center to the edges of the flower to create a decorative effect.
