Step 1: Draw a rectangular head with slightly rounded corners at the top center of your page.
Step 2: Add two large oval eyes on the head, positioned near the top and spaced evenly apart.
Step 3: Draw a small rectangular mouth below the eyes, centered on the head, to give your robot a cheerful expression.
Step 4: Create a rectangular body shape directly beneath the head, slightly wider than the head, with rounded edges for a friendly look.
Step 5: Add two rectangular arms extending from each side of the body, positioned about halfway down the sides and reaching outward.
Step 6: Draw two rectangular legs at the bottom of the body, standing straight down and slightly wider than the arms for balance.
Step 7: Add small circular feet on the bottom of each leg to give your robot a sturdy stance.
