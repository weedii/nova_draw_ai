Step 1: Draw a rectangular head slightly wider at the top with rounded corners sitting at the top center of your page.
Step 2: Add two small circular eyes toward the upper portion of the head, positioned symmetrically and spaced evenly from the centerline.
Step 3: Draw a small rectangular mouth centered below the eyes, ensuring it has a slight smile to give the robot a friendly expression.
Step 4: Create a rectangular body that is wider than the head and extends downward, leaving a small gap between the bottom of the head and the top of the body.
Step 5: Add two rectangular arms on each side of the body, starting at the shoulder level and extending outwards, with rounded ends for the hands.
Step 6: Draw two sturdy rectangular legs extending down from the bottom of the body, ensuring they are wider at the top and taper slightly toward the feet, which should have rounded edges.
Step 7: Finally, add a small rectangular antenna on top of the head, centered and pointing upwards, giving the robot a playful touch.
