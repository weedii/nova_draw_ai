Step 1: Draw a square head at the top center of your paper.
Step 2: Add two rectangular eyes on the front of the head, spaced evenly apart.
Step 3: Draw a small rounded mouth below the eyes, in the center of the head.
Step 4: Create a rectangular body shape directly beneath the head, ensuring it is wider than the head.
Step 5: Attach two rectangular arms on each side of the body, positioned slightly below the head and extending outwards.
Step 6: Add two straight legs coming down from the bottom of the body, ensuring they are slightly narrower than the body.
Step 7: Draw a pair of antennae on the top of the head, featuring small circles at the tips.
