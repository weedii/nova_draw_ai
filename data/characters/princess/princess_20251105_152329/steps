Step 1: Draw a round head in the center of the page.
Step 2: Add two small, pointy crowns resting on the top of the head, one on each side (head stays exactly the same).
Step 3: Draw two large, sparkling eyes with long eyelashes below the crowns, positioned in the middle of the head (head and crowns stay exactly the same).
Step 4: Add a tiny button nose centered below the eyes and a cheerful smile just below the nose (head, crowns, and eyes stay exactly the same).
Step 5: Sketch a graceful neck extending down from the base of the head, leading into a rounded gown that flares out softly at the bottom (head, crowns, eyes, nose, and smile stay exactly the same).
Step 6: Draw two delicate arms extending from the sides of the neck, bent at the elbows, with small hands open as if waving (head, crowns, eyes, nose, smile, and gown stay exactly the same).
Step 7: Add flowing hair cascading down from the sides of the head, framing the face and reaching just below the shoulders (all previous elements stay exactly the same).
