Step 1: Draw a round head at the top center of your paper.
Step 2: Add two small, pointed crown shapes on top of the head with a little space in between them.
Step 3: Draw two large, sparkling eyes below the crown, with round shapes that have tiny dots for pupils positioned in the upper part of the head.
Step 4: Add a small, delicate nose centered below the eyes, just above a slightly curved smiling mouth.
Step 5: Draw a flowing gown coming down from the sides of the head, wider at the bottom, creating a beautiful dress.
Step 6: Add two arms extending out from each side of the body, with small hands positioned slightly turned as if waving.
Step 7: Draw long, wavy hair that falls down from the head, framing the face and flowing down past the shoulders.
