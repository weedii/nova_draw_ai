Step 1: Draw a round head in the center of your page.
Step 2: Add two small pointed crown shapes on top of the head, representing a tiara (head stays exactly the same).
Step 3: Draw two big friendly eyes with small circles inside for pupils, positioned below the crown (head and crown stay exactly the same).
Step 4: Add a small button nose centered between the eyes, right above a cheerful smiling mouth (head, crown, and eyes stay exactly the same).
Step 5: Draw a long flowing hairstyle that drapes down the sides of the face, creating a "V" shape at the bottom (head, crown, eyes, nose, and mouth stay exactly the same).
Step 6: Add a rounded body shape below the head, with the shoulders a little wider than the head (head, crown, eyes, nose, mouth, and hair stay exactly the same).
Step 7: Draw two long, elegant arms extending from the shoulders, with small, graceful hands at the ends (head, crown, eyes, nose, mouth, hair, and body stay exactly the same).
