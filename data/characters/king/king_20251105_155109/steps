Step 1: Draw a rounded head at the top center of your page.
Step 2: Add a small crown on top of the head with three rounded peaks, ensuring it sits evenly atop the head.
Step 3: Draw two large friendly eyes below the crown, positioned symmetrically on each side of the head, with small circular pupils inside.
Step 4: Add a small, rounded nose between the eyes and slightly below them, giving the king a jovial look.
Step 5: Draw a wide, smiling mouth below the nose, with slight curves at the ends for a cheerful expression.
Step 6: Sketch a regal neck below the head, leading down to a broad, rounded body that suggests a royal robe.
Step 7: Add two outstretched arms on either side of the body, with each arm ending in a small rounded hand, to convey a welcoming gesture.
