Step 1: Draw a large oval head at the top center of your page.
Step 2: Add a crown on top of the head, making it a series of small arches with points reaching upward.
Step 3: Draw two round eyes below the crown, with thick brows above them for a regal expression.
Step 4: Add a small curved nose centered between the eyes and a wide, friendly smile below the nose.
Step 5: Draw a rounded body shape directly beneath the head that is slightly wider at the bottom.
Step 6: Add long, flowing robes on either side of the body, tapering down to the floor, with a subtle drape effect.
Step 7: Draw two arms extending out from the sides of the body, each arm holding a scepter in one hand, slightly outstretched.
