Step 1: Draw a round head at the top center of the paper.
Step 2: Add a tall, ornate crown resting on top of the head, with peaks and a decorative band.
Step 3: Draw two big, friendly eyes below the crown, with small dots inside for pupils.
Step 4: Add a small, curved nose centered below the eyes, and a wide, cheerful smile just below the nose.
Step 5: Draw a rounded body shape extending down from the head, giving the king a regal posture.
Step 6: Add two short arms on each side of the body, each with a hand resting at the sides.
Step 7: Draw a flowing cape attached at the shoulders, draping down the back of the body to give a sense of majesty.
